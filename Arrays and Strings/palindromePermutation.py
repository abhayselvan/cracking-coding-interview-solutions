'''
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
